1. Bottom-up, also known as tabulation.
    From the base case
    A bottom-up implementation's runtime is usually faster, as iteration does not have the overhead that recursion does.
    bottom-up uses iteration
2. Top-down, also known as memoization.
    A top-down implementation is usually much easier to write. This is because with recursion, the ordering of subproblems does not matter, whereas with tabulation, we need to go through a logical ordering of solving subproblems.
    top-down uses recursion
