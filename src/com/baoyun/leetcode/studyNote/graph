0. Disjoint Set
    0.1 Union Find
1. Minimum Spanning Tree
    1.1 Cut Property
    1.2 Kruskal’s Algorithm
2. DFS
    2.1 Used in finding all the path
    2.2 Used in travel all the nodes
3. BFS
    3.1 Used in finding the shortest path (unweighted)
    3.2 Used in travel all the nodes
4. Single Source Shortest Path (with weight)
    4.1 Dijkstra’s algorithm (only positive weight)
    4.2 Bellman Ford Algorithm (with negative weight)
        4.2.1 with not cycle and positive cycle -> the shortest path will be at most n-1 edge
                with negative cycle -> no shortest path
                detect negative cycle
        4.2.2 improvement
    4.3 SPFA Algorithm
5. Kahn's Algorithm / Topological sorting
